# pocketSelectAll
Add the ability to select all Pocket articles

Inspired in part by [this script](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/39554-pocket-select-all).
Will try to implement a button to use it in the same way but for now you need to copy the script.js code and paste it into the console after enabling bulk edit and it will select all visible articles.
